# Solutions for All Issues

## Issue 1: Login button doesn't redirect ✅ ALREADY FIXED
- The Login button in Navbar.tsx correctly uses `<Link to="/signin">Login</Link>`
- Both desktop and mobile versions work
- If not working: Clear browser cache and restart dev server

## Issue 2: Can't register account
**Root cause:** SignUp uses Firebase Authentication
**Solution:** Ensure Firebase is configured and backend signup endpoint exists

Check:
1. Firebase config in src/config/firebase.ts
2. Backend registration endpoint at http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register/
3. Console errors during registration

## Issue 3: Events only show in Dashboard, not other pages
**Root cause:** DashboardContext may not be refreshing after event creation
**Solution:** Ensure all planner pages use `events` from DashboardContext

Pages that should show events:
- Dashboard ✓
- EventsList ✓
- EventSettings ✓
- EventListForLayout ✓

## Issue 4: Redundant in Layout Editor
**Need clarification:** What is redundant?
- Duplicate buttons?
- Duplicate sections?
- Unnecessary features?

## Issue 5: App Settings not working properly
**Root cause:** AppSettings page may not be saving settings
**Solution:** Check SettingsService and ensure it persists settings
