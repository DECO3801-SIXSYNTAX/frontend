# ✅ Authentication System Fixed!

## The Problem

You had a **mismatch** in your authentication system:
- ❌ **Registration (SignUp)** → Registered user with **Firebase only**
- ❌ **Login (SignIn)** → Tried to login with **Django API**
- ❌ **Result:** User existed in Firebase but NOT in Django → Login failed with "No active account found"

## The Solution

Updated `AuthService.ts` to use **Django API for both registration and login**:

### Registration Flow (NEW):
```
1. Register with Django API (/api/auth/register/)
   ↓
2. Optional: Create user in Firebase (if configured)
   ↓
3. Auto-login via Django API (/api/auth/login/)
   ↓
4. Store JWT tokens in localStorage
   ↓
5. Return authenticated user
```

### Login Flow (Already working):
```
1. Login via Django API (/api/auth/login/)
   ↓
2. Optional: Sign in to Firebase (if configured)
   ↓
3. Store JWT tokens
   ↓
4. Route user based on role (admin/planner/vendor)
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ **src/services/AuthService.ts**
   - Updated `signUp()` to register with Django first
   - Added optional Firebase user creation
   - Added auto-login after registration
   - Stores JWT tokens in localStorage

## What To Do Now

### 1. **Delete Old Firebase User** (if you created one)
Since your old registration only created user in Firebase, you need to either:

**Option A: Use Firebase Console**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: `deco-ad56f`
3. Go to Authentication → Users
4. Find and delete the user you created

**Option B: Just Register Again**
The new registration will create user in Django, so just:
1. Use a different email address
2. Or delete the Firebase user first

### 2. **Test New Registration**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/signup
2. Fill in the form with a **NEW email** (or after deleting old Firebase user)
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. You should see "Welcome [name]! Your account has been created successfully"
5. You'll be auto-redirected to sign in

### 3. **Test Login**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/signin
2. Enter your **new** registered email and password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You should successfully login and be redirected to Dashboard! ✅

## Authentication System Overview

Your app now uses a **Hybrid System**:

### Django (Primary)
- ✅ User Registration
- ✅ User Login
- ✅ JWT Token Management
- ✅ Event Data API
- ✅ User Role Management

### Firebase (Optional)
- ✅ Google Sign-In
- ✅ User Profile Storage (Firestore)
- ✅ Real-time Data Sync
- ⚠️  Only created if Firebase credentials are configured

## How It Works

### Registration (signUp):
1. **Validates** form data
2. **POST** to `/api/auth/register/` with user data
3. If Firebase configured: Creates Firebase user + Firestore profile
4. **Auto-login**: POST to `/api/auth/login/`
5. **Stores**:
   - `access_token` in localStorage
   - `refresh_token` in localStorage
   - `currentUser` object in localStorage

### Login (signIn):
1. **POST** to `/api/auth/login/` with email/password
2. If Firebase configured: Signs in to Firebase
3. **Stores** JWT tokens
4. **Routes** based on role:
   - `ADMIN` → `/admin`
   - `PLANNER` → `/planner`
   - `VENDOR` → `/vendor`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User with this email already exists"

**Cause:** User exists in Django database

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use different email

# Option 2: Delete user from Django
cd backend
python3 manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> User.objects.filter(email='your-email@example.com').delete()
>>> exit()
```

### Issue: Still can't login

**Check these:**
1. Django backend is running: `python3 manage.py runserver`
2. Correct email/password
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Check tokens in localStorage:
   ```javascript
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('access_token'));
   ```

### Issue: "Firebase error" during registration

**This is OK!** Firebase is optional. If you see:
```
⚠️ Firebase user creation failed (optional)
```
This is fine - Django registration still succeeded.

## Backend User Model

Your Django user has these fields:
- `email` - User's email (used as username)
- `password` - Hashed password
- `name` - Full name
- `role` - 'admin' | 'planner' | 'vendor'
- `company` - Company name (for planners)
- `phone` - Phone number (for planners)
- `experience` - Experience level (for planners)
- `specialty` - Specialty (for planners)

## Testing Checklist

After fixing, verify:
- [ ] Can register new user (use NEW email!)
- [ ] Registration auto-logs you in
- [ ] Can login with registered credentials
- [ ] JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- [ ] User redirected to correct role page
- [ ] Can create events after login
- [ ] Events appear in Dashboard and Layout Editor

## Summary

**Before Fix:**
```
SignUp → Firebase Only ❌
SignIn → Django Only ❌
Result: Mismatch! Can't login ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
SignUp → Django + Optional Firebase ✅
SignIn → Django + Optional Firebase ✅  
Result: Perfect match! Login works! ✅
```

Now **register again with a new email** and you should be able to login successfully! 🎉
